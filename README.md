* **Bottom Performing Schools:** Highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on overall passing rate.
* **Math Scores by Grade:** Lists the average math score for students of each grade level (grades 9-12) at each school.
* **Reading Scores by Grade:** Lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (grades 9-12) at each school.
* **Scores by School Spending:** Breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges per student.
* **Scores by School Size:** Breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, and large).
* **Scores by School Type:** Breaks down school performance based on school type (charter vs. district).
